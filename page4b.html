    We first examine the gender-age demographic make-up in Suriname in 2014 in this treemap. We can see that young people between age 15-54 of both genders make up the majority of the population. Where male and female are evenly split and 35-54 being the demographic with the most people.   
  </p>
  <p>
    In this chart, however, we see that the majority of people who've committed suicide in Suriname are men, with men in the 35-54 age group having the highest number of suicides. 
  </p>
  <p>
      Looking at the two charts side-by-side, you can see that that suicide affects men disproportionately compared to women.
  </p>
    <p>
      In the following side, we will look at the age group breakdown in more detail.
