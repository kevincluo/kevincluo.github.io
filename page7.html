Researchers have shed light on the causes for suicide in Suriname. Bhavik Doshi at the London School of Economics writes in his research that Indian population make up almost 70% of the suicide death in Suriname and speculates that the reason could be poor economic conditions, lack of opportunities and domestic violence (https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/latamcaribbean/2017/03/15/the-silent-suicide-epidemic-in-surinames-indian-community-can-only-be-overcome-through-cultural-change/).

NGOs have sprung up to tackle the problem. For example, The Mind Console Center of the Swamapath Foundation was created in 2008 to address the rising suicide rates and the Win Groep was created to focus on health and welfare in the town of Nickerie. The government, however, should take more proactive steps in preventing suicide in the country (https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/latamcaribbean/2017/03/15/the-silent-suicide-epidemic-in-surinames-indian-community-can-only-be-overcome-through-cultural-change/).
